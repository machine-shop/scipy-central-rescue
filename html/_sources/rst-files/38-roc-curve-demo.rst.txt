This script can be used to understand the relationship between the signal
absent and signal present distributions and the ROC curve which they generate.
The distributions are assumed to be Gaussian and of equal variance.
The sliders at the bottom can be used to change the position the mean of each
distribution as well as the threshold.

This code was influenced by the matplotlib slider demo:
matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/widgets/slider_demo.html
