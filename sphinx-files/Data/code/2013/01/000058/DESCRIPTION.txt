Here I have written two Vector classes  Vector3D and LorentzVector which is also called four vector. In Vector3D class , we have three components x, y, and z while LorentzVector class consists of four components ,three space components x, y and z and one time component t. These vector classes are very important in physics and maths. Lorentz vectors and Lorentz transformation are very useful in special theory of relativity and high energy physics.
